This is the \"mission\" level - deciding which roads to take.\n\n### Road Network as a Graph\n\n**Nodes (Vertices):** Intersections, decision points\n**Edges:** Road segments connecting nodes\n**Weights:** Travel time, distance, or cost\n\n### Graph Representation\n\n$$G = (V, E)$$\n\nWhere:\n- $V$: Set of vertices (nodes)\n- $E$: Set of edges connecting vertices\n- $w(u, v)$: Weight/cost of edge from $u$ to $v$\n\n### Problem Formulation\n\n**Input:**\n- Graph $G = (V, E)$ with edge weights\n- Start node $s$\n- Goal node $g$\n\n**Output:**\n- Path $P = [s, v_1, v_2, \\ldots, g]$ that minimizes total cost\n\n**Cost Function:**\n$$\\text{cost}(P) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w(v_i, v_{i+1})$$\n\n### Applications in Autonomous Driving\n\n1. **Navigation**: Route from current location to destination\n2. **Rerouting**: Dynamic replanning when roads are blocked\n3. **Multi-objective**: Balance time, distance, fuel, safety\n4. **Time-dependent**: Account for traffic predictions"
